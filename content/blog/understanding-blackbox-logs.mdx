Blackbox logs are the key to understanding what's really happening with your drone during flight. This data-rich recording captures everything from gyro readings to motor outputs, giving you unprecedented insight into your quad's behavior.

## What Does Blackbox Record?

Every blackbox log contains:

- **Gyro data**: Raw angular velocity readings from your gyroscope
- **Accelerometer data**: Linear acceleration measurements
- **PID outputs**: The calculated corrections for each axis
- **Motor outputs**: Actual throttle values sent to each motor
- **RC inputs**: Your stick positions and switch states
- **Setpoint**: The target attitude based on your inputs

## Key Metrics to Analyze

### Gyro Noise

High-frequency noise in your gyro data indicates vibrations that can cause:
- Motor heating
- Reduced flight performance
- Prop wash oscillations

Look for noise spikes at specific frequencies - these often correspond to motor RPM harmonics.

### Step Response

When you make a quick stick input, how does your quad respond? A good tune shows:
- Fast initial response (high P)
- Minimal overshoot (proper D)
- Quick settling (balanced I)

### D-Term Noise

The derivative term amplifies high-frequency noise. If your D-term trace looks noisy, you may need:
- Better filtering
- Lower D gains
- Motor/prop balancing

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Oscillations at hover | P too high | Reduce P gain |
| Slow response | P too low | Increase P gain |
| Bounce-back after flips | D too low | Increase D gain |
| Hot motors | D too high or poor filtering | Reduce D or adjust filters |
| Drift in wind | I too low | Increase I gain |

## How FPVtune Analyzes Your Logs

Our AI performs comprehensive analysis including:

1. **Spectral Analysis**: Identifies noise frequencies and optimal filter placement
2. **Step Response Evaluation**: Measures your current tune quality
3. **Thermal Prediction**: Estimates motor temperature based on noise profile
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmarks against thousands of reference tunes

Instead of spending hours learning to read these graphs yourself, let our neural network do the heavy lifting. Upload your blackbox log and get actionable recommendations in seconds.

## Best Practices for Recording

For the best analysis results:

- Record 30-60 seconds of varied flight
- Include hover, forward flight, and some maneuvers
- Fly in calm conditions for baseline tuning
- Use high logging rate (2kHz recommended)
