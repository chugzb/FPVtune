Not all tunes are created equal. A quad optimized for freestyle will feel very different from one tuned for racing. Understanding these differences helps you dial in the perfect settings for how you actually fly.

## Freestyle Tuning Philosophy

Freestyle flying demands:

- **Prop wash handling**: Quick recovery during power loops and dives
- **Smooth stick feel**: Predictable response for tricks
- **Forgiveness**: The quad should help, not fight you

### Key Settings for Freestyle

**Higher D-term**: Freestyle pilots typically run higher D values to combat prop wash. The trade-off is slightly more motor heat, but the improved handling during aggressive maneuvers is worth it.

**D-min/D-max**: Use D-min for smooth cruising and let D-max kick in during quick moves. This gives you the best of both worlds.

**Feedforward**: Moderate feedforward provides instant response without feeling twitchy. Too much makes the quad feel nervous.

## Racing Tuning Philosophy

Racing is all about:

- **Minimal latency**: Every millisecond counts
- **Predictable response**: Consistent behavior lap after lap
- **Efficiency**: Clean power delivery for maximum speed

### Key Settings for Racing

**Lower filtering**: Racers often run more aggressive (less) filtering to minimize delay. This requires well-balanced props and motors.

**Crisp P-term**: Higher P for immediate response to stick inputs. The quad should go exactly where you point it, instantly.

**Lower D-term**: Less D means less delay, but you sacrifice some prop wash handling. On a smooth race track, this trade-off makes sense.

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | Freestyle | Racing |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| P Gain | Moderate-High | High |
| I Gain | Moderate | Moderate-Low |
| D Gain | High | Moderate |
| Filtering | Moderate | Minimal |
| Feedforward | Moderate | High |
| Priority | Feel & Recovery | Speed & Precision |

## Cinematic Flying

For smooth footage, you'll want:

- Lower rates for gentle movements
- Higher filtering for buttery smooth video
- Moderate PID values across the board
- Expo on your rates for fine control

## How FPVtune Adapts

When you use FPVtune, we ask about your flying style for a reason. Our AI adjusts recommendations based on whether you're:

- Sending it through gaps at 150km/h
- Throwing tricks in a bando
- Capturing cinematic mountain shots
- Cruising long range

Each style has different priorities, and your tune should reflect that.

## Finding Your Style

Most pilots don't fit neatly into one category. You might freestyle on weekdays and race on weekends. The good news is that a well-tuned quad can handle multiple styles reasonably well.

Start with a balanced tune from FPVtune, then make small adjustments based on what feels off. Keep notes on what you change and how it affects the feel.
