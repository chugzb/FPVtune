Hot motors are one of the most common issues FPV pilots face. While some warmth is normal, excessively hot motors can lead to reduced performance, shortened lifespan, and even mid-flight failures. Understanding the relationship between your tune and motor temperature is crucial.

## Why Do Motors Get Hot?

Motors heat up when they work harder than necessary. In the context of PID tuning, this usually means:

1. **Excessive D-term**: The derivative gain amplifies high-frequency noise, causing rapid motor corrections
2. **Poor filtering**: Unfiltered noise passes through to motor outputs
3. **Oscillations**: The flight controller constantly fighting itself
4. **Prop wash corrections**: Aggressive attempts to stabilize during turbulent air

## The D-Term Dilemma

D-term is essential for smooth flight - it dampens oscillations and reduces prop wash. But it's also the primary cause of motor heating because it responds to the rate of change in error, which includes noise.

The solution isn't simply to lower D-term (which would hurt flight performance), but to:

- Filter noise before it reaches the D-term calculation
- Use appropriate D-term lowpass settings
- Balance D-min and D-max values

## Safe Temperature Ranges

| Temperature | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Room temp - 50°C | Normal |
| 50°C - 60°C | Warm but acceptable |
| 60°C - 70°C | Hot - investigate cause |
| 70°C+ | Too hot - reduce D or improve filtering |

*Check motors immediately after landing for accurate readings.*

## FPVtune's Thermal Prediction

Our AI doesn't just optimize for flight feel - it also considers motor health. By analyzing your blackbox data, we can:

- Estimate motor temperature based on noise profile
- Recommend safe D-gain limits for your specific setup
- Suggest filter settings that balance performance and thermal safety

This predictive approach helps you avoid the trial-and-error of finding out your motors are too hot after a flight.

## Tips for Cooler Motors

1. **Balance your props**: Unbalanced props create vibrations that heat motors
2. **Check motor screws**: Loose screws cause frame resonance
3. **Soft-mount your FC**: Reduces vibration transmission to the gyro
4. **Use quality components**: Cheap motors and ESCs often run hotter
5. **Enable RPM filtering**: Allows less aggressive lowpass filtering

## When to Worry

If your motors are consistently hot despite proper tuning:

- Check for damaged bearings
- Inspect props for damage
- Verify ESC timing settings
- Consider motor/prop matching

Remember, a well-tuned quad should have motors you can comfortably touch after a normal flight. If you're burning your fingers, it's time to revisit your tune.
