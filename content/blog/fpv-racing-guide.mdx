FPV drone racing has exploded in popularity, with professional leagues, local meetups, and backyard battles happening worldwide. If you're looking to get into this thrilling sport, here's what you need to know.

## What is FPV Racing?

FPV (First Person View) racing puts you in the pilot's seat through video goggles. You see what the drone sees in real-time as you navigate through gates, around obstacles, and past competitors at speeds exceeding 150 km/h.

## Essential Gear

### The Quad

Racing quads are typically 5-inch builds optimized for:
- **Speed**: High KV motors and aggressive props
- **Durability**: Carbon fiber frames that survive crashes
- **Low weight**: Every gram matters when racing

### Goggles

Your window into the FPV world. Key considerations:
- Digital (DJI, HDZero, Walksnail) vs Analog
- Field of view
- Latency (lower is better for racing)
- DVR for recording flights

### Radio

A quality transmitter with:
- Low latency protocol (ELRS, TBS Crossfire)
- Hall effect gimbals
- Comfortable ergonomics

## Why Tuning Matters for Racing

In racing, milliseconds matter. A well-tuned quad gives you:

1. **Instant response**: The quad goes exactly where you point it
2. **Predictable behavior**: Consistent lap after lap
3. **Confidence**: Trust your equipment so you can focus on flying

### Racing-Specific Tune Considerations

- **Minimal filtering**: Less delay, more direct feel
- **High P-term**: Crisp, immediate response
- **Moderate D-term**: Just enough to prevent oscillation
- **High feedforward**: Anticipates your inputs

## Getting Started

1. **Join a community**: Find local pilots or online groups
2. **Practice on simulators**: Liftoff, Velocidrone, and others
3. **Start with a ready-to-fly**: Learn to fly before building
4. **Find a local track**: Many areas have FPV racing groups

## From Beginner to Competitive

The journey typically looks like:

1. **Learning to fly**: Master the basics in acro mode
2. **Building confidence**: Fly faster, take tighter lines
3. **Local racing**: Join casual races and meetups
4. **Competitive racing**: Enter leagues and tournaments
