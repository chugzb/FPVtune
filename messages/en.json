          "question": "File too large to upload?",
          "answer": "FPVTune supports log files up to 50MB. If file is too large, use Blackbox Explorer to open the log and export only the time segment you need to analyze. Or record shorter flights (30-60 seconds is sufficient) to avoid large files from long recordings."

          "question": "SD card read failure?",
          "answer": "If SD card cannot be read, try: 1) Re-insert SD card; 2) Format as FAT32 on computer; 3) Replace with high-quality SD card (recommend SanDisk or Samsung); 4) Check if flight controller SD card slot has dust or damage."

        "q5": {
          "question": "Onboard flash export is slow?",
          "answer": "Onboard flash read speed is usually slower than SD card, this is normal. Export may take several minutes, please be patient. If you frequently need to export logs, recommend using SD card storage for faster read speeds and larger capacity."

        "q6": {
          "question": "Log file corrupted and won't open?",
          "answer": "Log corruption usually occurs due to power loss during flight or storage media failure. Try using Blackbox Explorer's repair function, or re-record a complete flight. To avoid corruption, wait a few seconds after flight ends before powering off to let data fully write."
